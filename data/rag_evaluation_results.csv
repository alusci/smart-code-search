2. **Prepare Dense Embeddings**: Use OpenAI's API to generate dense embeddings for your data. These embeddings will be used for semantic search.

3. **Set Up BM25 for Full-Text Search**: Define an instance of `BM25BuiltInFunction` and pass it to the Milvus object. This function acts as a lightweight wrapper for the `Function` in Milvus, enabling full-text search capabilities.

4. **Create a Hybrid Search Instance**: Use the `MilvusCollectionHybridSearchRetriever` to combine both dense and sparse vector searches. This retriever will handle the integration of OpenAI dense embeddings and BM25 for hybrid search.

5. **Execute Hybrid Search**: Use the `search_type` or `hybrid_search()` method to perform the search. This method will query both vector and non-vector text fields in parallel, merge the results, and return the top matches from the unified result set.

By following these steps, you can effectively leverage the strengths of both semantic and keyword-based search techniques to improve search quality in your application.",1.0,0.9946681405696252,0.9999999999666667,1.0

1. `BaseExampleSelector`

These selectors are responsible for selecting and formatting examples to include as part of prompts for improved performance with few-shot learning.","The different types of example selectors available in the code for selecting examples in Langchain are:

1. **LengthBasedExampleSelector**: This selector likely chooses examples based on their length, possibly to match the desired length of the output or input.

2. **MaxMarginalRelevanceExampleSelector**: This selector probably uses a method like Maximal Marginal Relevance to select examples that are both relevant and diverse.

3. **SemanticSimilarityExampleSelector**: This selector likely selects examples based on their semantic similarity to a given input, ensuring that the examples are contextually relevant.

Additionally, there is a mention of a potential example selector in the `TYPE_CHECKING` section:

4. **NGramOverlapExampleSelector**: This selector might choose examples based on the overlap of n-grams between the input and the examples, focusing on lexical similarity.",1.0,0.9847344689878564,0.46666666665111106,0.5

If the `results` list is empty after a query, it breaks out of the loop, indicating that there are no more results to fetch. Additionally, it stops fetching more pages if the desired number of results (`top_k_results`) has been reached.","The code determines when to stop fetching additional pages of search results from Google Scholar based on two conditions:

1. **No Results on Current Page**: If the current page of results returns no results (`if not results:`), the code breaks out of the loop. This indicates that there are no more results to fetch, so there's no need to continue querying additional pages.

2. **Fetching the Required Number of Results**: The loop continues fetching pages until the `page` variable reaches a value that is less than `max((self.top_k_results - 20), 1)`. This ensures that the code fetches enough pages to potentially gather up to `self.top_k_results` results, but it stops early if fewer results are needed or available. Additionally, if `self.top_k_results` is not divisible by 20 and more than one page has been fetched, the code fetches only the remaining number of results needed (`self.top_k_results % 20`) from the last page.

These conditions ensure that the code efficiently retrieves the desired number of results without making unnecessary API calls.",0.75,1.0000000000000002,0.99999999995,1.0
