1. **Limiting Results**: The code uses a placeholder `{top_k}` to specify the maximum number of results to return. This is implemented using the `LIMIT` clause in the SQL query, which restricts the number of rows returned by the query. If the user does not specify a number of examples, the query defaults to this limit.

2. **Selecting Necessary Columns**: The code explicitly instructs not to query for all columns from a table. Instead, it emphasizes querying only the columns needed to answer the question. This is achieved by wrapping each column name in double quotes to denote them as delimited identifiers, ensuring that only the specified columns are included in the query.

3. **Schema Awareness**: The code is designed to be aware of the schema by using placeholders like `{table_info}` to include only the relevant tables and columns. It warns against querying columns that do not exist and emphasizes checking which column belongs to which table.

4. **Prompt Design**: The prompts used in the code guide the language model to generate queries that adhere to these constraints, ensuring that the generated SQL is both syntactically correct and efficient in terms of the data it retrieves.",1.0,0.9917388489438733,0.99999999998,0.8

Here's how it works:

1. **Method Definition**: The `embed_query` method takes a single string argument `text`, which is the text to be embedded.

2. **Embedding Process**: Inside the `embed_query` method, the `embed_documents` method is called with a list containing the single `text`. This is done by passing `[text]` to `embed_documents`.

3. **Return Value**: The `embed_documents` method returns a list of embeddings, one for each input text. Since `embed_query` is only embedding a single text, it accesses the first (and only) element of the returned list by using `[0]`.

4. **Final Output**: The `embed_query` method returns the embedding for the single query text as a list of floats.

In summary, the `embed_query` method leverages the `embed_documents` method to handle the embedding of a single query text by wrapping the text in a list, calling `embed_documents`, and then extracting the first embedding from the result.",1.0,0.9416552069287433,0.99999999995,0.8888888888888888

If the access token is not available (`if not self.access_token:`), it refreshes the access token using the method `_refresh_access_token_with_lock()`. This ensures that a valid access token is used for the requests.

When embedding documents in batches, the code processes the texts in chunks (`text_in_chunks`) and sends each chunk to the embedding service. If the response from the service contains an error code, specifically error code 111, it indicates that the access token has expired or is invalid. In this case, the code refreshes the access token again and retries the request for that chunk. This mechanism ensures that the code can handle expired or invalid access tokens gracefully by refreshing them as needed.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.14285714285714285
