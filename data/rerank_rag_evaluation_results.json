It takes an input, such as a query or a question, and processes it through the chain to produce an output. The method is part of a system that involves retrieving and processing information, often using a language model or other tools.

In the specific context of retrieval and processing, the `chain.invoke` method is used to:

1. Take in chat history and a new question to create a ""standalone question"" for retrieval purposes. This helps in fetching relevant documents by providing necessary context without including unnecessary information.

2. Pass the standalone question to a retriever, which returns relevant documents.

3. Process the retrieved documents or responses to provide an answer to the input question.

The method is part of a larger framework that may include additional logic, such as further processing with language models or handling tool calls, as seen in the custom chain example provided. However, the exact details of how `chain.invoke` works in every scenario depend on the specific implementation of the chain and the tools or models it uses.

I don't have enough information to provide more detailed specifics about the internal workings of `chain.invoke` beyond what is described in the context.","The `chain.invoke` method in the provided code is part of a processing pipeline designed to retrieve and process information using a series of operations. Here's how it works in the given context:

1. **Retrieval and Formatting**: The chain starts with a dictionary that includes a ""context"" key. This key is associated with a process that involves retrieving documents using a `retriever` and then formatting these documents using the `format_docs` function. The `format_docs` function takes a list of documents and joins their content into a single string, separated by double newlines.

2. **Question Handling**: The ""question"" key in the dictionary is associated with a `RunnablePassthrough()`, which likely means that the question is passed through without modification.

3. **Prompt Construction**: The formatted context and the question are then passed to a `prompt` component. This component likely constructs a prompt that combines the context and the question in a format suitable for the language model.

4. **Language Model Processing**: The constructed prompt is then fed into a language model (`llm`), which in this case is an instance of `ChatOpenAI` using the ""gpt-3.5-turbo-0125"" model. The language model processes the prompt to generate a response.

5. **Output Parsing**: Finally, the output from the language model is passed through a `StrOutputParser()`, which likely processes the raw output string into a more structured or readable format.

The `chain.invoke` method essentially orchestrates these steps, taking an input question, retrieving and formatting relevant context, constructing a prompt, generating a response using a language model, and parsing the output. This method is used to answer questions by leveraging the capabilities of a language model in conjunction with a retrieval system.",,0.0,0.3085650460599033,0.23076923076923078

2. **Use OpenAI Embeddings for Dense Search**: Pass an instance of `OpenAIEmbeddings` to the `embedding` parameter of the `Milvus.from_documents` method. This will handle the dense vector part of the hybrid search.

3. **Use BM25 for Sparse Search**: Pass an instance of `BM25BuiltInFunction` to the `builtin_function` parameter of the `Milvus.from_documents` method. This will handle the sparse vector part of the hybrid search using the BM25 algorithm.

4. **Specify Vector Fields**: Set the `vector_field` parameter to include both ""dense"" and ""sparse"" fields, which correspond to the outputs of the OpenAI embeddings and BM25 function, respectively.

5. **Connection and Configuration**: Provide necessary connection arguments such as the URI and set the `consistency_level` and `drop_old` parameters as needed.

Here is a code snippet demonstrating these steps:

```python
from langchain_milvus import BM25BuiltInFunction, Milvus
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings

vectorstore = Milvus.from_documents(
    documents=documents,
    embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings(),
    builtin_function=BM25BuiltInFunction(),
    vector_field=[""dense"", ""sparse""],
    connection_args={
        ""uri"": URI,
    },
    consistency_level=""Strong"",
    drop_old=True,
)
```

This setup allows you to perform a hybrid search by combining the strengths of both dense and sparse vector searches.","To perform a hybrid search using Milvus with OpenAI dense embeddings and BM25 for full-text search, you can follow these steps:

1. **Initialize Milvus**: Set up a Milvus instance, which can be either Milvus Standalone or Milvus Distributed, as full-text search with BM25 is not supported in Milvus Lite.

2. **Prepare Dense Embeddings**: Use OpenAI's API to generate dense embeddings for your data. These embeddings will be used for semantic search.

3. **Set Up BM25 for Full-Text Search**: Define an instance of `BM25BuiltInFunction` and pass it to the Milvus object. This function acts as a lightweight wrapper for the `Function` in Milvus, enabling full-text search capabilities.

4. **Create a Hybrid Search Instance**: Use the `MilvusCollectionHybridSearchRetriever` to combine both dense and sparse vector searches. This retriever will handle the integration of OpenAI dense embeddings and BM25 for hybrid search.

5. **Execute Hybrid Search**: Use the `search_type` or `hybrid_search()` method to perform the search. This method will query both vector and non-vector text fields in parallel, merge the results, and return the top matches from the unified result set.

By following these steps, you can effectively leverage the strengths of both semantic and keyword-based search techniques to improve search quality in your application.",,0.9999999999999997,0.84999999997875,

1. Install the `__package_name__` package using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -U __package_name__
   ```

2. Set the environment variable `__MODULE_NAME___API_KEY` with your API key:
   ```bash
   export __MODULE_NAME___API_KEY=""your-api-key""
   ```

I don't have enough information to provide further details on the specific initialization parameters required for the __ModuleName__Retriever.","To set up the `__ModuleName__Retriever` using the `__package_name__` integration package, follow these steps:

1. **Create an Account**: Sign up for a `__ModuleName__` account. This is necessary to access the services provided by `__ModuleName__`.

2. **Generate an API Key**: Once you have an account, generate an API key. This key will be used to authenticate your requests to the `__ModuleName__` services.

3. **Install the Integration Package**: Install the `__package_name__` integration package. This package contains the necessary tools and libraries to work with `__ModuleName__Retriever`.

4. **Set Environment Variables**: Set the `__MODULE_NAME___API_KEY` environment variable with the API key you generated. This will allow the integration package to authenticate your requests.

5. **Refer to Documentation**: For detailed documentation on all features and configurations of `__ModuleName__Retriever`, refer to the [API reference](https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/retrievers/__module_name__.retrievers.__ModuleName__.__ModuleName__Retriever.html).

These steps will help you get started with setting up and using the `__ModuleName__Retriever` with the `__package_name__` integration package.",,0.0,0.4816849816729395,

1. **LengthBasedExampleSelector**: This selector likely chooses examples based on their length, possibly to match the desired length of the output or input.

2. **MaxMarginalRelevanceExampleSelector**: This selector probably uses a method like Maximal Marginal Relevance to select examples that are both relevant and diverse.

3. **SemanticSimilarityExampleSelector**: This selector likely selects examples based on their semantic similarity to a given input, ensuring that the examples are contextually relevant.

Additionally, there is a mention of a potential example selector in the `TYPE_CHECKING` section:

4. **NGramOverlapExampleSelector**: This selector might choose examples based on the overlap of n-grams between the input and the examples, focusing on lexical similarity.",1.0,0.9875376077693435,0.30952380950833336,

If the `results` list is empty after a query, it breaks out of the loop, indicating that there are no more results to fetch.

If `top_k_results` is not divisible by 20 and more than one page has been fetched, it fetches only the remaining needed results from the last page.","The code determines when to stop fetching additional pages of search results from Google Scholar based on two conditions:

1. **No Results on Current Page**: If the current page of results returns no results (`if not results:`), the code breaks out of the loop. This indicates that there are no more results to fetch, so there's no need to continue querying additional pages.

2. **Fetching the Required Number of Results**: The loop continues fetching pages until the `page` variable reaches a value that is less than `max((self.top_k_results - 20), 1)`. This ensures that the code fetches enough pages to potentially gather up to `self.top_k_results` results, but it stops early if fewer results are needed or available. Additionally, if `self.top_k_results` is not divisible by 20 and more than one page has been fetched, the code fetches only the remaining number of results needed (`self.top_k_results % 20`) from the last page.

These conditions ensure that the code efficiently retrieves the desired number of results without making unnecessary API calls.",,1.0000000000000002,0.99999999995,
