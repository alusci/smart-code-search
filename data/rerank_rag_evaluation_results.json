It works in the following way:

1. It uses the chat history and the new question to create a ""standalone question."" This step ensures that the question has enough context for the retrieval process without including unnecessary information from the entire conversation.

2. The standalone question is then passed to a retriever, which returns relevant documents based on the question.

The context does not provide further details on the internal workings of `chain.invoke` beyond these steps. Therefore, I don't have enough information to answer more specifically how `chain.invoke` processes information beyond what is described.","The `chain.invoke` method in the provided code is part of a processing pipeline designed to retrieve and process information using a series of operations. Here's how it works in the given context:

1. **Retrieval and Formatting**: The chain starts with a dictionary that includes a ""context"" key. This key is associated with a process that involves retrieving documents using a `retriever` and then formatting these documents using the `format_docs` function. The `format_docs` function takes a list of documents and joins their content into a single string, separated by double newlines.

2. **Question Handling**: The ""question"" key in the dictionary is associated with a `RunnablePassthrough()`, which likely means that the question is passed through without modification.

3. **Prompt Construction**: The formatted context and the question are then passed to a `prompt` component. This component likely constructs a prompt that combines the context and the question in a format suitable for the language model.

4. **Language Model Processing**: The constructed prompt is then fed into a language model (`llm`), which in this case is an instance of `ChatOpenAI` using the ""gpt-3.5-turbo-0125"" model. The language model processes the prompt to generate a response.

5. **Output Parsing**: Finally, the output from the language model is passed through a `StrOutputParser()`, which likely processes the raw output string into a more structured or readable format.

The `chain.invoke` method essentially orchestrates these steps, taking an input question, retrieving and formatting relevant context, constructing a prompt, generating a response using a language model, and parsing the output. This method is used to answer questions by leveraging the capabilities of a language model in conjunction with a retrieval system.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.15384615384615385

1. **Initialize Milvus with Documents and Embeddings:**
   - Use `Milvus.from_documents` to initialize the vector store with your documents.
   - Use `OpenAIEmbeddings` for dense embeddings.
   - Use `BM25BuiltInFunction` for the BM25 full-text search.

2. **Specify Vector Fields:**
   - Set the `vector_field` parameter to include both `dense` (for OpenAI embeddings) and `sparse` (for the output field of the BM25 function).

3. **Connection and Consistency:**
   - Provide the necessary `connection_args` such as the URI.
   - Set the `consistency_level` to ""Strong"" if needed.
   - Use `drop_old=True` to remove old data if required.

This setup allows you to perform a hybrid search by combining dense vector similarity (using OpenAI embeddings) and sparse vector similarity (using BM25 for full-text search).

If you need more detailed steps or code examples, the context does not provide them.","To perform a hybrid search using Milvus with OpenAI dense embeddings and BM25 for full-text search, you can follow these steps:

1. **Initialize Milvus**: Set up a Milvus instance, which can be either Milvus Standalone or Milvus Distributed, as full-text search with BM25 is not supported in Milvus Lite.

2. **Prepare Dense Embeddings**: Use OpenAI's API to generate dense embeddings for your data. These embeddings will be used for semantic search.

3. **Set Up BM25 for Full-Text Search**: Define an instance of `BM25BuiltInFunction` and pass it to the Milvus object. This function acts as a lightweight wrapper for the `Function` in Milvus, enabling full-text search capabilities.

4. **Create a Hybrid Search Instance**: Use the `MilvusCollectionHybridSearchRetriever` to combine both dense and sparse vector searches. This retriever will handle the integration of OpenAI dense embeddings and BM25 for hybrid search.

5. **Execute Hybrid Search**: Use the `search_type` or `hybrid_search()` method to perform the search. This method will query both vector and non-vector text fields in parallel, merge the results, and return the top matches from the unified result set.

By following these steps, you can effectively leverage the strengths of both semantic and keyword-based search techniques to improve search quality in your application.",0.9230769230769231,0.9999999999999997,0.7499999999625,0.5714285714285714

These selectors are responsible for selecting and formatting examples to include as part of prompts for improved performance with few-shot learning.","The different types of example selectors available in the code for selecting examples in Langchain are:

1. **LengthBasedExampleSelector**: This selector likely chooses examples based on their length, possibly to match the desired length of the output or input.

2. **MaxMarginalRelevanceExampleSelector**: This selector probably uses a method like Maximal Marginal Relevance to select examples that are both relevant and diverse.

3. **SemanticSimilarityExampleSelector**: This selector likely selects examples based on their semantic similarity to a given input, ensuring that the examples are contextually relevant.

Additionally, there is a mention of a potential example selector in the `TYPE_CHECKING` section:

4. **NGramOverlapExampleSelector**: This selector might choose examples based on the overlap of n-grams between the input and the examples, focusing on lexical similarity.",1.0,0.9875376077693435,0.3333333333,0.5

This means it will stop fetching additional pages when the number of pages fetched reaches the calculated limit based on the `top_k_results` attribute, which specifies the number of results to return. If `top_k_results` is less than 20, it will fetch only one page. However, the exact stopping condition is not fully clear from the provided context, as it seems to depend on the value of `top_k_results` and how it is set or used elsewhere in the code.","The code determines when to stop fetching additional pages of search results from Google Scholar based on two conditions:

1. **No Results on Current Page**: If the current page of results returns no results (`if not results:`), the code breaks out of the loop. This indicates that there are no more results to fetch, so there's no need to continue querying additional pages.

2. **Fetching the Required Number of Results**: The loop continues fetching pages until the `page` variable reaches a value that is less than `max((self.top_k_results - 20), 1)`. This ensures that the code fetches enough pages to potentially gather up to `self.top_k_results` results, but it stops early if fewer results are needed or available. Additionally, if `self.top_k_results` is not divisible by 20 and more than one page has been fetched, the code fetches only the remaining number of results needed (`self.top_k_results % 20`) from the last page.

These conditions ensure that the code efficiently retrieves the desired number of results without making unnecessary API calls.",0.8571428571428571,0.0,0.9999999999,0.5714285714285714
